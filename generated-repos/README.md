# How to create a new project
Make a new project under `generated-repos/<project-name>`.

Use bootstrap.md with your development coding agent when creating the spec documents for the new repo. One way is to copy the file into your coding agent CLI.

Example
```
Read the boostrap.md file, and help me create a project that is
  recreating minecraft in the browser
```
